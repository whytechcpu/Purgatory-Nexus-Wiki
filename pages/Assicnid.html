			<p>Assicnid is a character in Purgatory Nexus and the 3rd character from Batch-1.</p>
			<p>Due to an error in it's creation, it ended up having some spider-like attributes. Those being an increased amount of legs, and a powerful jaw.</p>
			<p>Assicnid looks like a black human pictograph, it is really tall, no arms, has a black tie with white outlines and 4 legs.</p>
			<p>Assicnid, due to his mutations, is barely conscious and can only simply assist people with tasks, and doesn't really have anything else going on in it's life.</p>
